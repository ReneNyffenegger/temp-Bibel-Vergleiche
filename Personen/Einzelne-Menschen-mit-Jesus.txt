dam
Role: First man, representing humanity’s fall into sin.

Comparison: Adam’s disobedience brought death; Jesus, the "last Adam," brought life through obedience (Romans 5:12–19).

Abraham
Role: Father of faith, patriarch of Israel.

Comparison: Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac foreshadowed God’s sacrifice of Jesus (Genesis 22; John 3:16). Jesus fulfills Abraham’s promise to bless all nations.

Moses
Role: Prophet and liberator of Israel.

Comparison: Moses delivered Israel from Egypt; Jesus delivers humanity from sin. Unlike Moses, who disobeyed God (Numbers 20:12), Jesus remained perfectly obedient.

David
Role: King of Israel, "man after God’s heart".

Comparison: David’s flawed kingship contrasts with Jesus’ perfect, eternal reign (2 Samuel 7:12–16; Luke 1:32–33). Jesus fulfills David’s messianic lineage.

Joseph
Role: Suffering servant who saved nations.

Comparison: Joseph’s betrayal, exaltation, and provision for his brothers prefigure Jesus’ redemptive work (Genesis 37–50; Philippians 2:5–11).

Samson
Role: Judge with physical strength.

Contrast: Samson’s moral failures (Judges 16) contrast with Jesus’ sinlessness and spiritual strength.

Elijah
Role: Prophet who challenged idolatry.

Comparison: Elijah’s miracles (e.g., raising the widow’s son) foreshadow Jesus’ greater authority over life and death (1 Kings 17; John 11).

Daniel
Role: Faithful exile and visionary.

Comparison: Daniel’s integrity in Babylon mirrors Jesus’ sinless life. Both faced unjust accusations but trusted God’s sovereignty.

Jonah
Role: Reluctant prophet to Nineveh.

Comparison: Jonah’s three days in the fish prefigure Jesus’ resurrection (Matthew 12:40). Both brought salvation to outsiders.

Peter
Role: Apostle who denied Christ.

Comparison: Peter’s failure and restoration (John 21) highlight Jesus’ grace. Peter later became a bold preacher of Christ’s resurrection.

Paul
Role: Persecutor turned apostle.

Comparison: Paul’s transformation (Acts 9) exemplifies Jesus’ power to redeem sinners. Both suffered for proclaiming the gospel.
